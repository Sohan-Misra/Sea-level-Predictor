# Sea level predictor

This project is used to predict future sea levels through the year 2050 using linear regression using a python script.

## Goal:
To better understand the working of python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scipy, and to understand the basics of linear regression.

## Technologies used:
* Python
* Numpy 
* Pandas
* Matplolib
* Scipy

## Steps to run:
* Install python and necessary libraries.
* Clone this repository to the your device.
* Import the pandas, numpy, matplotlib and scipy libraries.
* Run main.py in the terminal using either of the commands based on your python version:
    * <mark>python3 main.py</mark> for python 3.
    * <mark>python main.py</mark> for python 2.

The calculations are in sea_level_predictor.py.

## Data Source:
Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014 from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.
